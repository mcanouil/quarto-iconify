--- @brief Mark the code blocks that hold the output of an executed cell.
--- @description Quarto puts the result of an executed cell in a Div with the
--- `cell-output` classes, and the code block inside carries no language class.
--- A CodeBlock filter sees that block on its own and cannot tell it apart from
--- a fenced block written without a language. This pass marks it while the
--- parent Div is still in reach, so the language and window passes can leave it
--- alone.
